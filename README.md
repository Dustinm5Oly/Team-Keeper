## Description

* This application is to be able to allow a user to follow prompts through node to create a webpage html file that shows a their team and information about the members.
* My motivation to create this app was to be able to understand how to apply js and node to create different documents through input in node.js.
* I designed this app to allow myself to better understand node.js and OOS and how each document applies to the next
* The webpage allows the user to generate a random movie, food and drink for their date. While also being able to rate their previous dates based on the random selections.
* I was able to learn how to generate an html document and apply class and styling through bootstrap and font-awesome through JS.
